Project Overview 
This project is meant to be a resource website that helps people living in Kentucky or traveling to Kentucky to locate idea places for kayaking. The website allows users to find resources around kayaking as well as add their favorite spots through an interactive form.

Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements
1. A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon
2. Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow. For example, display it back to the user on button click, or change a setting on the page based on a section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit or that just refreshes the page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and use it somehow.
3. Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner or menu animation. Note: CSS Animations are not included in the assigned Treehouse track, you will have to research this on your own

If needed, any special instructions required for the reviewer to run your project
