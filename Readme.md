Project Overview 
This project is meant to be a resource website that helps people living in Kentucky or traveling to Kentucky to give them ideas around why Kentucky is such a great option for a kayaking trip as well as answer some of their general questions. This website has a Home Page, an About Us page, and a Contact Us page as resources for vistors. The website is created to be mobile friendly on all devices as well as perform on desktop variations. The Contact Us form validates users entries by populating a response in the console. 

Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements
1. A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, in the form of a hamburger menu that is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon
2. Creation of a Contact Us form that validates the "name" field by requiring it to be at least three characters in legnth. The validation is displayed back to the user on button click.
3. Creation of a CSS menu animation in the "Contact Us" button that is clickable and a border box has movement after clicking.
4. Used Flexbox to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. This is done throughout the site (on both the homepage and the contact us page) by swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop.
